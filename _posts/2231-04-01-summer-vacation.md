When my internship ends in summer, I still have two weeks before university starts again.
So I guess I'll take some vacation and visit a nice place.
I found this beautiful [lake in Germany](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Lake+Hasso/@52.3937701,13.1300822,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a85f365e24cfdf:0xddeba1f0751fb1b4!8m2!3d52.3937701!4d13.1322709?hl=en) which seems to be worth a visit!
It's said to be the best swimming lake in Germany, if not in Europe!!!
Alternatively, I may go hiking with a friend in [Spain](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/37.526884/-4.508547).

What did you do during your last holidays? Any experiences you would like to share?
