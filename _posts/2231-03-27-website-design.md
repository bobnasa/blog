A friend asked me to design a website for her.
I am not very experienced with HTML and CSS yet.
If you have any ideas, I would be very grateful to hear them!

Maybe you can even send me a design you created in the past?
If you have one, please send it to bob 42 nasa at gmail dot com (no spaces) because I don't check my protonmail address regularly.
But please put everything in one HTML, I don't want my downloads folder to quill over :D
It would be great to see some inspirations!
I will keep you posted on how this projects goes.
